I am a postdoctoral researcher on conversational systems and large language models at Georgia Tech. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Utah, advised by [Prof. Qingyao Ai](https://qingyaoai.github.io/) and [Prof. Vivek Srikumar](https://svivek.com/). I obtained my Master's degree in Math at the University of Minnesota Duluth, advised by [Prof. Ted Pedersen](https://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/) and [Prof. Yang Li](https://yangli-stat.github.io/). I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Risheng Liu](https://rsliu.tech/) during my undergraduate study in Dalian University of Technology. My resume can be found [here](https://github.com/zhenduow/zhenduow.github.io/blob/master/files/Resume.pdf).
